  "body": "## Project Abstract\r\nPlayers use the PSMove wand to swing at incoming objects.  Any object that comes into contact with the user's weapon will be cut, and the user will gain a point.  They must score as many points within a limited time period over the course of a few rounds.  Aside from the PSMove, this project also utilizes the Oculus Rift headset.\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\nThis project was created by Ryan Tsao and Matthew Tesfaldet.\r\n\r\n## Other Credit\r\nThe following people's/groups' resources were used to complete this project:\r\n* Synty Studios for most of the assets.
